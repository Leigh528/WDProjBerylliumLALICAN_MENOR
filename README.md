# Description:

Welcome, dear creators and readers, to the Vestigial Archives, an archive dedicated to documenting the stories and personalities of the authors’ treasured original characters (OCs). Here, you’ll find detailed descriptions of their lore, the world they live in, relationships between characters, and even their old designs or concepts.

But what if I want to create my own lore/ character designs?

Not to worry! We’ll be sure to provide you with some useful tips and tricks to help young creators like you create your own lore that will make your own OCs feel more alive.. Maybe even more than that.

So, ladies, gentlemen, and they thems, are you ready to embark on a journey through the OCverse?

# Outline:
Main hall (home page)
Description: Contains the introduction and overview of the website. These will contain the hyperlinks to the other subpages (e.g., Characters, worlds) and maybe some secrets too. 

**Subpages**
* Characters: 
  * Description: A collection of some of the authors' OCs., As of now, it is still incomplete. Hopefully, in the future, we will be able to reach our goal of completion.  

* World information:
  * Description:  Explains how the fictional world works ( this may only apply to ONE of our authors, though.. I’m looking at you, Leigh)

* Art:
  * Description: Will showcase some art of said characters and maybe will show some future designs that might be canon to their universe

* Guide: 
  * Description: This page will explain some tips and tricks for creators to make lore and/or designs for their characters!

* About the Authors:
  * Description: As the title suggests, this page is about the two authors, Sol and Leigh, and how their interests culminated in the creation of their original characters.

* Quiz page:
  * Description: It would be similar to those “ which ___ are you?” type of quizzes, but instead will use our original characters. 



# How JS will be incorporated:

 We will be creating a “what type of OC are you?” quiz, which will also utilize logical functions, event handling, and data management in JavaScript. The results will vary based on the answers the player/user picks
